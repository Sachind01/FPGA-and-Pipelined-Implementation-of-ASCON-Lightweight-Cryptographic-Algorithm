IDLE → INITIALIZE: When encryption_start is high.
INITIALIZE → ASSOCIATED_DATA: If l (length of associated data) is not zero and permutation_ready is high.
INITIALIZE → PTCT: If l is zero and y (length of plain text) is not zero and permutation_ready is high.
INITIALIZE → FINALIZE: If l and y are zero and permutation_ready is high.
ASSOCIATED_DATA → PTCT: If block_ctr equals s-1 and permutation_ready is high and y is not zero.
ASSOCIATED_DATA → FINALIZE: If block_ctr equals s-1 and permutation_ready is high and y is zero.
ASSOCIATED_DATA: Stay in the same state if block_ctr is not equal to s-1 and permutation_ready is high.
PTCT → FINALIZE: If block_ctr equals t-1.
PTCT: Stay in the same state if block_ctr is not equal to t-1 and permutation_ready is high.
FINALIZE → DONE: When permutation_ready is high.
DONE → IDLE: When encryption_start is high.
